    Located in the Northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces and Taurus, Aries is a zodiac constellation that was one of 48 constellations described by Ptolemy. Though now known as a ram, in Babylonian times, Aries was known as “The Agrarian Worker” and was featured in an agricultural calendar.

        The transformation of the constellation into a ram likely occurred in later Babylonian times when it was closely associated with the figure of a shepherd. In ancient Greek mythology, Aries was connected with a golden ram that rescued Phrixus and Helle, the twin sons of a king, on the orders of Hermes.

        Aries has three major stars that form an asterism, or pattern of stars—Hamal, Sheratan, and Mesarthim. Hamal is the brightest star and the 48th brightest in the sky. Its name is taken from the Arabic word meaning “lamb” or “head of the ram.”
